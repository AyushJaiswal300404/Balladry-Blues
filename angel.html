                You were smart, clever and kind <br/>
                I envied 'cause I was always behind <br/>
                I still remember your infectious smile<br/>
                 At first thought, it was all a guile<br/>
                For me it was a game of chess<br/>

                <br/>
                After loosing from you a hundred times<br/>
                I remember when I was crying <br/>
                On that gloomy twilight <br/>
                You consoled me saying<br/>
                what's wrong in trying <br/>
                one hundred and oneth time<br/>
                I saw you for who you were<br/>
                You were smart, clever and kind <br/>
                I learnt that I didn't have to fight<br/><br/>

                <h3>His Home</h3>
        <p>
            There was a boy who had many dreams<br/>

            He used to get excited at little thing<br/>
            
            Wanted to be normal like everyone else<br/>
            
            But the scary dreams get best of him <br/>
    
            So he always sat alone and ate by himself<br/>
            
            Even though it was tough, he kept going on<br/>
            
            But then came a wrecking storm <br/>
            
            He realised that he didn't had enough fuel to keep going on<br/>
            
            He was broken and he cried a lot<br/>
            
            Wanted to give up everything which was left<br/>
            
            But couldn't cause he knew that <br/>
            
            Something like that would be foolish to do<br/>
            
            He realised that instead of throwing away the pieces<br/>
            
            which was left and ending it all <br/>
            
            He could try for some more time <br/>
            
            And get it right the next time.<br/>
            
            After these the boy became a man<br/>
            
            And is still going on in search of a place<br/>
            
            He could call his home.<br/>

            <h3>Paradise Pt-1</h3>
            <p>
                I am tired of this world I want people to understand.<br/>
            	I have already been through a lot.<br/> 
	            I need some time to forget.<br/>
                <br/>
	            I dream of a happy life.<br/>
	            A lovely house by river nile<br/>
	            See sun shining bright on a pretty isle <br/>
	            Childrens playing and your beautiful smile. <br/>
	            This is the place I dreamt about  <br/>
	            A place which can be our hideout.<br/>
                <br/>
                Maybe this is too much to ask? <br/>
                But I no longer want to wear this mask.<br/> 
                This could be our paradise <br/>
                The tranquility and your elegant eyes<br/>
                Will you still hold my hands? <br/>
                And stand by me in this lands?<br/>
