            <p>
                Woke pissed off this morning <br/>
                I feel so fucking different.<br/>
                I don't care how you're <br/>
                If you're hurt or not<br/>
                I do what I feel right<br/>
                Don't think about being black or white<br/>
                I don't need your lesson<br/>
                Cause I am not someone who <br/>
                Do shit to make impression. <br/>
                <br/><br/>
                You are nothing like me<br/>
                Cause you're afraid to do anything new<br/>
                I do things on my whim <br/>
                Ain't need your guide to swim<br/>
                I don't waste my time <br/>
                Looking at others class<br/>
                Couldn't care less if you think I am<br/>
                A heartless psychopath.<br/><br/>

                <h3>Selfish</h3>
        <p>
            Fuck it, do you think you're better than me<br/>
            Like really I say let's try it and then we will see <br/>
            I don't show off like you,<br/>
            I'm better off than being you<br/>
            <br/>
           
            Maybe I am shy and sometimes to be honest cry<br/>
            But who the bloody hell are you asking me to justify<br/>
            I am good boy, don't wanna hurt feeling of anyone<br/>
            But the game you're playing I have already won<br/>
            Like a zillion times <br/>
            I didn't got what I have on luck<br/>
            I have unlike you gone through some serious stuff.<br/>
           
            I have big dreams and there is no fucking way<br/>
            I am gonna let you stop me  from achieving it <br/>
            When I say I'm gonna do something, I do it<br/>
            Don't give a shit about what someone else think<br/>
            I have gone through a lot, I deserve it<br/>
            So fuck the world. I'm doing this for me<br/>

            <h3>Superman</h3>
            <p>
                May I have your attention, please?<br/>
Yes all of you who are broke and turning <br/>
deaf to the noise of mayhem and crash.<br/>
Wouldn't it be better to scream it out.<br/>
Fuck society and focus on yourself.<br/>
If you look it in a little better light you'll find<br/>
Nobody is gonna save you from mess you're in.<br/>
Not your mate , family or so called friends.<br/>
But you yourself.<br/><br/>
So, stop giving a fuck about criticism they have.<br/>
Cause you are better off without it.<br/>
You have every right to a wonderful life.<br/>
So, stop giving a fuck about their selfish advice.<br/>
No one can tell you that you don't have it in you.<br/>
Trust me, you are not the only one <br/>
who feel angel will come and save you.<br/>
But let me break it to you, you have to become <br/>
superman and rescue you by yourself.<br/>
