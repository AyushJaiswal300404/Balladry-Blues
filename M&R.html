            <p>
         I feel like my world is crumbling <br/>
         Everything I do goes wrong <br/>
         Wishes of mine never comes true<br/>
         Unsure if dreams which I see <br/>
         Will I be able to see through?<br/><br>
         
    
         Am I doing enough to get what I want?<br/>
         Or I am getting wasted over stupid things.<br/>
         I want to fix it all and come out of mist<br/>
         But I am unable to keep up the tryst.<br/>
         With which I was born.<br/><br/>
    
        The old bridges had to be burned <br/>
         The feellings had to be unlearned.<br/>
         All vicious offers has to be spurned <br/>
         This is the debt which I have to compensate.<br/><br/>

        <p>
         Hello, how have you been?<br/>
         Last night, I was walking in the rain<br/>
          Thought that I saw you<br/>
         But it was your silhouette.<br/><br/>
    
         Fuck, I thought I had moved on<br/>
          But you in my mind still intrude on.<br/>
          I still remember 4th of September<br/>
          You in that off-white dress <br/>
          Which was little big for you I'd say<br/><br>
    
          You were unlike others<br/>
          Filled my life with colours.<br/>
          But after you, here I'm<br/>
          Reminiscing your sublime.<br/>

	     People walks in and out of my life<br/>
	     As if it is a metro highway<br>
         On a busy festival night<br/>
	     Believer gives up after strife<br/>
	     But I don't let any tears come out <br/>
	     From these hazel brown eyes.<br/><br>
	     </p>
	     <p>
	     Cause baby you've traded <br/>
         A Ferrari for a jeep<br/>
         And the creep you chose <br/>
         Is yours to keep<br/>
	     Anything you do can never<br/>
        get under my skin<br/>
	     No more regret over <br/>
         what it could have been.<br/>

            <p>
        It's hard for me<br/>
        To put up a smile <br/>
        Act like everything's fine<br/>
        While I'm dying inside<br/>
        <br/>
        It's hard for me <br/>
        To have no real friends <br/>
        'cause my soul isn't free<br/>
         While I do what society tells<br/>
        <br/>
        It's hard for me<br/>
        To just not give a fuck<br/>
        While I drift into raging sea<br/>
         And leave it all on the luck<br/>
        Act like everything's fine<br/>

            <p>
        We used to talk all night long<br/>
        In the silence with no lights on<br/>
        Saying goodbye and start talking again<br/>
        Getting wet in the first rain<br/>
        It was just magical to me<br/>
        You were perfect for me<br/>
        <br/>
        So please come back once more<br/>
        I will hold you closer to my heart<br/>
        After you, I am feeling so down<br/>
        I need to once again hear your sound<br/>
        It was just enchanting to me<br/>

            <p>
        Maybe that your phone got drained<br/>
        Or you have something else unexplained<br/>
        So you are calling after three days<br/>
        Asking forgiveness for all delays<br/>
        I know you just call me when you're hurt<br/>
        But I was the fool who always assert.<br/>
        <br/>
        You like talking about yourself<br/>
        Turning to all my problems deaf.<br/>
        I have realised that for you<br/>
        I wasn't even your friend.<br/>
        I was just a good time-pass.<br/>
        <br/>
        Feeling used,
        I blame myself for being desperate<br/>
        Going through hell in accepting it.<br/>
        I know that I have got to burns yours<br/>
        Till there is nothing left.<br/>
        Have to let go to start loving myself.<br/>
